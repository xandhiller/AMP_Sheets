\section{Recommended Resources}
Split by Physics/Mathematics and then listed in order of importance:
\subsection{Physics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Revision lecture
  \item Lecture Notes' Additional Notes -- learn the derivations mentioned in
    the revision lecture. 
  \item Learn the rest of the derivations. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Mathematics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Examples in the lecture notes
  \item Tutorial problems
  \item \textit{Vector Calculus} by Susan J. Colley \\
    (there are solutions/instructor's manuals for this, which gives a good 
    feedback loop).
  \item \textit{Problems and Solutions for Complex Analysis} by Rami Shakarchi
\end{itemize}

\section{Radioactive Decay}
Derive the formula for the number of atoms present during radioactive decay, 
$N(t)$, given that:

\begin{equation}
  - \frac{dN}{dt} \propto N
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  - \frac{dN}{dt} = \lambda dt
\end{equation}

Where:

$N \equiv$ the number of atoms present

$\lambda \equiv$ rate of radioactive decay (specific to the element)

$N_{0} \equiv$ is the number of atoms present at $t=0$

\section{Gauss'/Divergence Theorem}
Consider the field:

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{F} = e^{y}_{} \cos(z) \mathbf{i} + 
  \sqrt{x^{3}_{} + 1} \sin(z)  \mathbf{j} +
  ( x^{2}_{} + y^{2}_{} + 3 )  \mathbf{k}
\end{equation}

And the surface:

\begin{equation}
  z = (1- x^{2}_{} - y^{2}_{} ) e^{1 - x^{2}_{} - 3y^{2}_{}}_{} 
  \text{for } z \geq 0
\end{equation}

\section{Parameterised Surface}

Consider the field:

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{X}(s,t) = \begin{bmatrix} s \\ s+t \\ t  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Where $0 \leq s \leq 1$ and $0 \leq t \leq 2$

\begin{equation}
  \int^{}_{}  \int^{}_{\mathbf{X}} \left( x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}  \right) dS
\end{equation}

Ask yourself, what is visually happening here?
